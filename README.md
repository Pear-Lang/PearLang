## Introduction

**Pear** is a high-level programming language tailored for ease of use and efficient file manipulation. Whether you're automating tasks, managing files, or developing small applications, Pear offers a straightforward syntax and powerful built-in functions to streamline your workflow.

---

Certainly! I've updated the **Installation** section of the Pear Programming Language Documentation to include instructions for running `install.bat` as part of the installation process. Below is the revised **Installation** section with the necessary additions:

---

## Getting Started

### Installation

Before you can start writing and executing Pear scripts, ensure that you have the Pear interpreter installed on your system. The interpreter is responsible for parsing and executing your Pear code.

1. **Download the Interpreter:**
   - Visit the [Pear GitHub Repository](https://github.com/your-repo/pear) (Replace with actual link) and download the latest version of the Pear interpreter.

2. **Extract and Install:**
   - Extract the downloaded archive to your desired directory.
   - **Run the Installation Script:**
     - **For Windows Users:**
       - Navigate to the extracted directory and double-click on `install.bat` to execute the installation script.
     - **For Unix-based Systems:**
       - Open your terminal.
       - Navigate to the extracted directory.
       - Run the installation script by executing:
         ```bash
         ./install.sh
         ```
   - Ensure that the interpreter (`pear.exe` for Windows or `pear` for Unix-based systems) is accessible via your system's PATH for easy execution from the command line.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to verify the installation:
     ```bash
     pear --version
     ```
   - You should see output indicating the Pear version installed.

### Running Pear Scripts

Once installed, you can execute Pear scripts using the Pear interpreter from your terminal.

**Syntax:**
```bash
pear path/to/your/script.pear
```

**Example:**
```bash
pear C:/Users/Julian/Desktop/PEAR-V2/test/writeFilepeartest.pear
```

---

### Running Pear Scripts

Once installed, you can execute Pear scripts using the Pear interpreter from your terminal.

**Syntax:**
```bash
pear path/to/your/script.pear
```

**Example:**
```bash
pear C:/Users/Julian/Desktop/PEAR-V2/test/writeFilepeartest.pear
```

---

## Basic Syntax

### Comments

Use the `#` symbol to add comments to your Pear scripts. Comments are ignored by the interpreter and are useful for documenting your code.

```pear
# This is a single-line comment

# You can also add comments alongside code
define num x = 10;  # Initialize x with 10
```

### Variables

Declare variables using the `define` keyword followed by the data type, variable name, and an optional initial value.

**Syntax:**
```pear
define [data_type] [variable_name] = [value];
```

**Supported Data Types:**
- `num` - Number (integer or float)
- `str` - String
- `bool` - Boolean (`true` or `false`)
- `obj` - Object

**Examples:**
```pear
define num x = 5;
define str name = "Pear User";
define bool isActive = true;
define obj person = {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30,
    isEmployed: true,
};
```

### Data Types

Pear supports the following primary data types:

- **Number (`num`):** Represents numerical values, both integers and floating-point numbers.
  
  ```pear
  define num age = 25;
  define num price = 19.99;
  ```

- **String (`str`):** Represents sequences of characters.
  
  ```pear
  define str greeting = "Hello, World!";
  ```

- **Boolean (`bool`):** Represents logical values `true` or `false`.
  
  ```pear
  define bool isActive = true;
  ```

- **Object (`obj`):** Represents collections of key-value pairs.
  
  ```pear
  define obj car = {
      make: "Toyota",
      model: "Corolla",
      year: 2020,
  };
  ```

---

## Operators

Operators allow you to perform operations on variables and values. Pear supports various types of operators, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, and unary operators.

### Arithmetic Operators

Perform mathematical calculations.

| Operator | Description       | Example | Result         |
|----------|-------------------|---------|----------------|
| `+`      | Addition          | `3 + 2` | `5`            |
| `-`      | Subtraction       | `5 - 2` | `3`            |
| `*`      | Multiplication    | `4 * 3` | `12`           |
| `/`      | Division          | `10 / 2`| `5`            |
| `%`      | Modulus (Remainder)| `7 % 3` | `1`            |

**Example:**
```pear
define num a = 10;
define num b = 3;
define num sum = a + b;       # sum = 13
define num difference = a - b;# difference = 7
define num product = a * b;   # product = 30
define num quotient = a / b;  # quotient = 3.333...
define num remainder = a % b; # remainder = 1
```

### Comparison Operators

Compare values and return a boolean result.

| Operator | Description       | Example | Result  |
|----------|-------------------|---------|---------|
| `==`     | Equal to          | `5 == 5`| `true`  |
| `!=`     | Not equal to      | `5 != 3`| `true`  |
| `>`      | Greater than      | `7 > 4` | `true`  |
| `<`      | Less than         | `2 < 5` | `true`  |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `5 >= 5` | `true` |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    | `3 <= 4` | `true` |

**Example:**
```pear
define num x = 10;
define num y = 5;

define bool isEqual = x == y;      # false
define bool isNotEqual = x != y;   # true
define bool isGreater = x > y;     # true
define bool isLess = x < y;        # false
define bool isGreaterOrEqual = x >= 10; # true
define bool isLessOrEqual = y <= 5;     # true
```

### Logical Operators

Perform logical operations on boolean values.

| Operator | Description       | Example               | Result  |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------|
| `&&`     | Logical AND       | `true && false`       | `false` |
| `||`     | Logical OR        | `true || false`       | `true`  |
| `!`      | Logical NOT       | `!true`               | `false` |

**Example:**
```pear
define bool a = true;
define bool b = false;

define bool andResult = a && b; # false
define bool orResult = a || b;  # true
define bool notResult = !a;     # false
```

### Unary Operators

Perform operations on a single operand.

| Operator | Description       | Example | Result |
|----------|-------------------|---------|--------|
| `+`      | Unary plus (positive)| `+5`  | `5`    |
| `-`      | Unary minus (negative)| `-5` | `-5`   |
| `!`      | Logical NOT       | `!true` | `false`|

**Example:**
```pear
define num x = 5;
define num positive = +x;    # 5
define num negative = -x;    # -5
define bool isInactive = !true; # false
```

---

## Control Structures

Control structures allow you to dictate the flow of your program based on conditions and loops.

### Conditional Statements

Execute code blocks based on specific conditions.

**If Statement:**
```pear
if (condition) {
    # Code to execute if condition is true
} 
```

**If-Else Statement:**
```pear
if (condition) {
    # Code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    # Code to execute if condition is false
}
```

**If-Else If-Else Statement:**
```pear
if (condition1) {
    # Code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    # Code to execute if condition2 is true
} else {
    # Code to execute if neither condition1 nor condition2 is true
}
```

**Example:**
```pear
define num x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
    print("x is greater than 5");
} else {
    print("x is less than or equal to 5");
}
```

### Loops

Repeat code blocks multiple times based on conditions.

**For Loop:**
```pear
define num i;
for (i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) {
    print("For Loop Iteration: " + i);
}
```

**While Loop:**
```pear
define num counter = 0;
while (counter < 3) {
    print("While Loop Counter: " + counter);
    counter = counter + 1;
}
```

**Do-While Loop:**
```pear
define num counter = 0;
do {
    print("Do-While Loop Counter: " + counter);
    counter = counter - 1;
} while (counter > 0);
```

**Example:**
```pear
# For Loop
for (define num i = 1; i <= 3; i = i + 1) {
    print("Iteration: " + i);
}

# While Loop
define num j = 1;
while (j <= 3) {
    print("Count: " + j);
    j = j + 1;
}

# Do-While Loop
define num k = 1;
do {
    print("Do-While Count: " + k);
    k = k + 1;
} while (k <= 3);
```

---

## Functions

Functions allow you to encapsulate reusable code blocks, making your programs more organized and modular.

### Function Declaration

Declare a function using the `function` keyword, followed by the function name, parameters, and a code block.

**Syntax:**
```pear
function [function_name]([parameters]) {
    # Function body
}
```

**Example:**
```pear
function greet(name) {
    print("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```

### Function Calls

Invoke a function by using its name followed by parentheses enclosing any required arguments.

**Syntax:**
```pear
[function_name]([arguments]);
```

**Example:**
```pear
greet("Pear User");  # Outputs: Hello, Pear User!
```

### Built-in Functions

Pear comes with several built-in functions to facilitate common operations. Below is a list of essential built-in functions:

#### 1. `print(value)`

Outputs the specified value to the console.

**Usage:**
```pear
print("Hello, World!");
print(123);
```

#### 2. `readFile(path)`

Reads and returns the content of the file at the specified path.

**Usage:**
```pear
define str content = readFile("C:/path/to/file.txt");
print(content);
```

#### 3. `writeFile(path, data)`

Writes the provided data to the file at the specified path. If the file exists, it overwrites its content.

**Usage:**
```pear
writeFile("C:/path/to/file.txt", "This is some content.\n");
```

#### 4. `appendFile(path, data)`

Appends the provided data to the end of the file at the specified path without overwriting existing content.

**Usage:**
```pear
appendFile("C:/path/to/file.txt", "This line is appended.\n");
```

#### 5. `editFile(path, data)`

Overwrites the existing content of the file at the specified path with new data.

**Usage:**
```pear
editFile("C:/path/to/file.txt", "New content replaces old content.\n");
```

#### 6. `moveFile(sourcePath, destinationPath)`

Moves a file from the source path to the destination path. This can also be used to rename files.

**Usage:**
```pear
moveFile("C:/path/to/source.txt", "C:/path/to/destination.txt");
```

#### 7. `dedefineeFile(path)`

Dedefinees the file at the specified path.

**Usage:**
```pear
dedefineeFile("C:/path/to/file.txt");
```

#### 8. `createDirectory(path)`

Creates a new directory at the specified path. If the directory already exists, it does nothing.

**Usage:**
```pear
createDirectory("C:/path/to/new_directory");
```

---

## Error Handling

Proper error handling ensures that your programs can gracefully handle unexpected situations without crashing.

### Try-Catch-Finally

Use `try-catch-finally` blocks to handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of your code.

**Syntax:**
```pear
try {
    # Code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
    # Code to handle the error
} finally {
    # Code that always executes, regardless of an error
}
```

**Example:**
```pear
try {
    define str content = readFile("C:/path/to/nonexistent_file.txt");
    print(content);
} catch (error) {
    print("Error reading file: " + error);
} finally {
    print("Attempted to read the file.");
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **`try` Block:** Contains code that might throw an error.
- **`catch` Block:** Executes if an error is thrown in the `try` block. The error is captured in the `error` variable.
- **`finally` Block:** Executes after the `try` and `catch` blocks, regardless of whether an error occurred.

---

## File Operations

Pear provides a suite of built-in functions to handle file operations efficiently. Below are detailed explanations and usage examples for each file operation.

### Creating Directories

Use the `createDirectory` function to create new directories. This is essential for organizing files within your project structure.

**Syntax:**
```pear
createDirectory("C:/path/to/directory");
```

**Example:**
```pear
createDirectory("C:/Users/Julian/Desktop/PEAR-V2/test/output");
createDirectory("C:/Users/Julian/Desktop/PEAR-V2/test/backup");
print("Directories 'output' and 'backup' have been created at C:/Users/Julian/Desktop/PEAR-V2/test.");
```

### Writing to Files

The `writeFile` function allows you to create new files or overwrite existing ones with specified content.

**Syntax:**
```pear
writeFile("C:/path/to/file.txt", "Your content here.\n");
```

**Example:**
```pear
writeFile("C:/Users/Julian/Desktop/PEAR-V2/test/output/test.txt", "This is the initial content of the test file.\n");
print("File 'test.txt' has been created and written to at C:/Users/Julian/Desktop/PEAR-V2/test/output/.");
```

### Reading from Files

Retrieve and utilize the content of files using the `readFile` function.

**Syntax:**
```pear
define str content = readFile("C:/path/to/file.txt");
print(content);
```

**Example:**
```pear
define str initialContent = readFile("C:/Users/Julian/Desktop/PEAR-V2/test/output/test.txt");
print("Content of 'test.txt':\n" + initialContent);
```

### Appending to Files

Add new content to the end of an existing file without altering its current content using the `appendFile` function.

**Syntax:**
```pear
appendFile("C:/path/to/file.txt", "Additional content.\n");
```

**Example:**
```pear
appendFile("C:/Users/Julian/Desktop/PEAR-V2/test/output/test.txt", "This line has been appended.\n");
print("Appended a new line to 'test.txt' at C:/Users/Julian/Desktop/PEAR-V2/test/output/.");
```

### Editing (Overwriting) Files

Use the `editFile` function to replace the entire content of a file with new data.

**Syntax:**
```pear
editFile("C:/path/to/file.txt", "New content replacing old content.\n");
```

**Example:**
```pear
editFile("C:/Users/Julian/Desktop/PEAR-V2/test/output/test.txt", "This is the overwritten content of the test file.\n");
print("File 'test.txt' has been overwritten with new content at C:/Users/Julian/Desktop/PEAR-V2/test/output/.");
```

### Moving Files

Relocate files from one directory to another or rename them using the `moveFile` function.

**Syntax:**
```pear
moveFile("C:/path/to/source.txt", "C:/path/to/destination.txt");
```

**Example:**
```pear
moveFile("C:/Users/Julian/Desktop/PEAR-V2/test/output/test.txt", "C:/Users/Julian/Desktop/PEAR-V2/test/backup/test_backup.txt");
print("File 'test.txt' has been moved to 'backup/test_backup.txt'.");
```

### Dedefineing Files

Remove unwanted files from your system using the `dedefineeFile` function.

**Syntax:**
```pear
dedefineeFile("C:/path/to/file.txt");
```

**Example:**
```pear
dedefineeFile("C:/Users/Julian/Desktop/PEAR-V2/test/backup/test_backup.txt");
print("File 'backup/test_backup.txt' has been dedefineed.");
```

---

## Data Structures

Pear supports fundamental data structures like arrays and objects, enabling you to store and manipulate collections of data efficiently.

### Arrays

Arrays store ordered collections of elements, which can be of any data type.

**Declaration:**
```pear
define num[] numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
define str[] names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];
```

**Accessing Elements:**
```pear
define num firstNumber = numbers[0]; # 1
define str secondName = names[1];   # "Bob"
```

**Iterating Through Arrays:**
```pear
for (define num i = 0; i < numbers.length; i = i + 1) {
    print("Number: " + numbers[i]);
}
```

**Example:**
```pear
define num[] scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88];
for (define num i = 0; i < scores.length; i = i + 1) {
    print("Score " + (i + 1) + ": " + scores[i]);
}
```

### Objects

Objects store collections of key-value pairs, allowing you to represent complex data structures.

**Declaration:**
```pear
define obj person = {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30,
    isEmployed: true,
};
```

**Accessing Properties:**
```pear
print("Name: " + person.name);       # "John Doe"
print("Age: " + person.age);         # 30
print("Employed: " + person.isEmployed); # true
```

**Modifying Properties:**
```pear
person.age = 31;
print("Updated Age: " + person.age); # 31
```

**Example:**
```pear
define obj book = {
    title: "Pear Programming",
    author: "Jane Smith",
    pages: 250,
};

print("Book Title: " + book.title);
print("Author: " + book.author);
print("Pages: " + book.pages);

# Update pages
book.pages = 300;
print("Updated Pages: " + book.pages);
```

---

## Modules

Modules allow you to organize your code into separate files, promoting reusability and maintainability.

### Importing Modules

Use the `import` keyword to include functions, classes, or other modules into your current script.

**Syntax:**
```pear
import { function1, function2, Class1 } from "./path/to/module.pear";
```

**Example:**
```pear
import { multiply, fetchData, Calculator } from "./module.pear";

define num result = multiply(4, 5);
print("Multiplied Result: " + result);

define str data = fetchData("https://api.example.com/data");
print("Fetched Data: " + data);

define obj calc = new Calculator();
calc.add(10, 20);
print("Calculator Result: " + calc.result);
```

### Exporting Functions and Classes

Use the `export` keyword to make functions and classes available for import in other scripts.

**Syntax:**
```pear
export function [function_name](parameters) {
    # Function body
}

export class [ClassName] {
    # Class properties and methods
}
```

**Example:**
```pear
# module.pear

export function multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
}

export class Calculator {
    define num result = 0;

    function add(a, b) {
        this.result = a + b;
    }

    function subtract(a, b) {
        this.result = a - b;
    }
}
```

---

## Classes

Pear supports object-oriented programming through classes, allowing you to create reusable and modular code.

### Class Declaration

Define a class using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name and its properties and methods.

**Syntax:**
```pear
class [ClassName] {
    # Properties
    define [data_type] [property_name] = [initial_value];
    
    # Methods
    function [methodName](parameters) {
        # Method body
    }
}
```

**Example:**
```pear
class Calculator {
    define num result = 0;

    function add(a, b) {
        this.result = a + b;
    }

    function subtract(a, b) {
        this.result = a - b;
    }
}
```

### Creating Instances

Instantiate a class using the `new` keyword.

**Syntax:**
```pear
define obj [instanceName] = new [ClassName]();
```

**Example:**
```pear
define obj calc = new Calculator();
calc.add(10, 20);
print("Calculator Result: " + calc.result); # Outputs: 30
```

### Methods

Classes can have methods (functions) that operate on their properties.

**Example:**
```pear
class Person {
    define str name = "";
    define num age = 0;

    function setName(newName) {
        this.name = newName;
    }

    function setAge(newAge) {
        this.age = newAge;
    }

    function greet() {
        print("Hello, my name is " + this.name + " and I am " + this.age + " years old.");
    }
}

# Using the Person class
define obj person = new Person();
person.setName("Alice");
person.setAge(28);
person.greet(); # Outputs: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 28 years old.
```

---

## Examples

### Comprehensive File Operations Script

Below is an example Pear script that demonstrates creating directories, writing, reading, appending, editing, moving, and dedefineing files. It also includes error handling using `try-catch-finally`.

**File:** `writeFilepeartest.pear`

```pear
# writeFilepeartest.pear

# Description:
# This Pear program demonstrates various file operations including creating directories,
# writing to files, reading files, appending data, editing (overwriting) files, moving files,
# and dedefineing files. All operations utilize specific absolute paths based on the defined base directory.

# 1. Define the Base Directory
define str baseDir = "C:/Users/Julian/Desktop/PEAR-V2/test";

# 2. Functions

# Function to greet a user
function greet(name) {
    print("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

# 3. Creating Directories
# Create 'output' and 'backup' directories within the base directory

createDirectory(baseDir + "/output");
createDirectory(baseDir + "/backup");

print("Directories 'output' and 'backup' have been created at " + baseDir + ".");

# 4. Writing to a File
# Write initial content to 'output/test.txt'

writeFile(baseDir + "/output/test.txt", "This is the initial content of the test file.\n");
print("File 'test.txt' has been created and written to at " + baseDir + "/output/.");

# 5. Reading from a File
# Read and print the content of 'output/test.txt'

define str initialContent = readFile(baseDir + "/output/test.txt");
print("Content of 'test.txt':\n" + initialContent);

# 6. Appending to a File
# Append additional data to 'output/test.txt'

appendFile(baseDir + "/output/test.txt", "This line has been appended.\n");
print("Appended a new line to 'test.txt' at " + baseDir + "/output/.");

# Read and print the updated content
define str appendedContent = readFile(baseDir + "/output/test.txt");
print("Updated Content of 'test.txt':\n" + appendedContent);

# 7. Editing (Overwriting) a File
# Overwrite the existing content of 'output/test.txt' with new data

editFile(baseDir + "/output/test.txt", "This is the overwritten content of the test file.\n");
print("File 'test.txt' has been overwritten with new content at " + baseDir + "/output/.");

### Explanation of Each Section

1. **Defining the Base Directory:**
   - Sets a specific path where all file operations will take place, ensuring consistency and preventing path-related errors.
   - Uses forward slashes `/` for compatibility within Pear scripts on Windows.

2. **Creating Directories:**
   - Uses `createDirectory` to create `output` and `backup` directories within the base directory.
   - Confirms creation with a print statement.

3. **Writing to a File:**
   - Creates `test.txt` in the `output` directory and writes initial content.
   - Confirms creation and writing.

4. **Reading from a File:**
   - Reads the content of `test.txt` and prints it to verify the write operation.

5. **Appending to a File:**
   - Appends a new line to `test.txt` without overwriting existing content.
   - Reads and prints the updated content to confirm the append operation.

6. **Editing (Overwriting) a File:**
   - Overwrites `test.txt` with new content using `editFile`.
   - Reads and prints the overwritten content to verify the edit.

7. **Moving a File to Another Path:**
   - Moves `test.txt` from the `output` directory to the `backup` directory, renaming it to `test_backup.txt`.
   - Reads and prints the content from the new location to confirm the move.

8. **Dedefineing a File:**
   - Dedefinees `test_backup.txt` from the `backup` directory.
   - Attempts to read the dedefineed file within a `try-catch` block to confirm dedefineion without crashing the interpreter.

9. **Using the Greet Function:**
   - Demonstrates a simple function usage by greeting the user.

10. **Additional Operations:**
    - Creates, reads, writes, and appends to additional files (`anotherInput.txt` and `anotherOutput.txt`) to showcase more file operations.

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Path Usage:**
   - Always define a base directory and use it to construct file paths. This approach prevents hard-coding paths throughout your scripts and makes maintenance easier.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Utilize `try-catch-finally` blocks to handle potential errors gracefully, preventing your scripts from crashing unexpectedly.

3. **Modular Code:**
   - Organize your code into functions and modules to promote reusability and maintainability.

4. **Descriptive Variable Names:**
   - Use clear and descriptive names for variables and functions to enhance code readability.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Comment your code generously to explain the purpose of functions, variables, and complex logic.

6. **Testing:**
   - Test your scripts incrementally. Start with basic operations and gradually add more complexity, verifying each step to catch errors early.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors and Solutions

1. **Runtime Error: Undefined Variable: [function_name]**
   - **Cause:** The function `[function_name]` is not defined or not registered in the interpreter.
   - **Solution:** Ensure that the function is correctly implemented and declared in the interpreter's `setupBuiltIns` method. Restart the interpreter after making changes.

2. **Parser Errors Related to Export Statements**
   - **Issue:** Exporting variables or incorrect syntax.
   - **Solution:** Only export functions and classes. Ensure proper syntax when declaring exports.
   
   **Correct Usage:**
   ```pear
   export function multiply(a, b) {
       return a * b;
   }
   
   export class Calculator {
       # class methods
   }
   ```
   
3. **File Not Found Errors (`ENOENT`)**
   - **Cause:** Attempting to read or manipulate a file that does not exist.
   - **Solution:** Verify that the file path is correct. Ensure that previous operations (like moving or dedefineing files) have been compdefineed successfully before accessing them.

4. **Permission Denied Errors (`EACCES`)**
   - **Cause:** Lack of necessary permissions to perform file operations in the specified directory.
   - **Solution:** Check and modify directory permissions to allow read/write operations. Run the interpreter with elevated privileges if necessary.

5. **Syntax Errors in Pear Scripts**
   - **Cause:** Incorrect syntax, such as missing semicolons, unmatched braces, or improper function declarations.
   - **Solution:** Review your script for syntax errors. Use consistent formatting and indentation to enhance readability and spot mistakes easily.

### Steps to Resolve Errors

1. **Review Error Messages:**
   - Carefully read the error messages provided by the interpreter. They often indicate the line number and nature of the error.

2. **Check Function Definitions:**
   - Ensure that all functions used in your script are properly defined and declared in the interpreter.

3. **Verify File Paths:**
   - Double-check all file paths for accuracy and consistency, especially when using concatenation with the base directory.

4. **Test Incrementally:**
   - Isolate problematic sections by testing smaller parts of your script to identify where the error originates.

5. **Consult Documentation:**
   - Refer to this documentation for syntax guidelines and function usages to ensure correct implementation.
